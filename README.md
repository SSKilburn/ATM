# ATM
Java ATM program developed during the Spring 2017 semester for Professor Brian Lawton's Java II class at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. 
This program was developed as a group project with the help of Sara Tracy.
While both of us actively developed the entirety of the project (as was necessary to ensure all methods and classes
worked properly), my primary contributions were as follows:
-The do-while and switch-case statement in the Account class
-The calcInterest() method in the Account class
-The deposit() method in the Account class
-The do-while and switch-case statement in the ATM class
-The populateAccts() method in the ATM class
-The array in the ATM class
